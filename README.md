# lgbt-survey-viewer
Code and data needed to create the [LGBT Survey 2017 Data Viewer](https://government-equalities-office.shinyapps.io/lgbt-survey-2017/).

## Set up 

To run the app locally you will need to have R and RStudio installed. You will need to install all R packages in the ui.R and server.R at the top of the scripts. 

Next the RDS file in the /data folder needs to be converted into a SQLDB.sqlite file by running the R script inside of the /data folder.

Finally, open the server.R file in RStudio and click 'Run App'.
